## This script works with boardmaps API using suds lib.

### Some preparations.
You need to install 2 libs:


* [Suds](https://fedorahosted.org/suds/) - soap-based client for python3.
You can install it using pip
```
pip install suds-jurko
```


* [xlrd](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlrd) - this lib we'll use for excel files parsing.
You can install it using pip too
```
pip install xlrd"
```
