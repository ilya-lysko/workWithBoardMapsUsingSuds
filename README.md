This script works with boardmaps servers using API. I use suds lib for easily work.

Some preparations.
You need to install 2 libs:

1). suds
This is soap-based client for python3.
You can install it using pip - "pip install suds-jurko"

2). xlrd
This lib we'll use for excel files parsing.
You can install it using pip too - "pip install xlrd"

If you don't have pip -- you can easily install it from official site, google will help you.
